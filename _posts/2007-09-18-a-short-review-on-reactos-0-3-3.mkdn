title: A short Review on ReactOS 0.3.3 
--- 

FreeWin95 has come a long way since it has been renamed in 1998 
and is now called ReactOS.

The new version 0.3.3 of the Windows 2000 clone already has a lot to offer and
has significantly evolved in almost all areas compared to the last release.
The developers have made a lot of progress in the lower system area (i. e. the
NT Kernel) as well as in the application segment. Let's have a look at some
new features! 

### Setup

Due to the fact that I've tested ReactOS using the pre-configured 
VMWare Virtual Appliance (VMWare Fusion Version 1.0 (51348) on a
MacBook 1.83 GHz to be precise) I can't say much about the installation
process of the new version using "real" hardware. However I've tried to
install it with the Install CD that can be downloaded on the [project
homepage][3]. Unfortunately I wasn't very successful. Somehow ReactOS was not
able to allocate the free space on my virtual hard disk...The last time I used
the Install-CD on an old 300 MHz Computer I simply wiped my old partition out,
created a new one ([fat32 only][4] guys :), formatted it and started the
Installer. I had no problems. On the other hand it can be dangerous to install
ReactOS on the same disk as Windows or Linux. Maybe the Installer doesn't care
and assimilates all disk space ([All your system are belong to us][5]).
But: Hey! MS does the same with all competitors, and maybe ReactOS simply aims
to clone that approach ;) However the Virtual Appliance worked very smooth on
my system. During the test I didn't have much problems setting up and using
the virtualized OS. 


### Bootup

When I fire up the machine a nice bootloader appears and
you may select between the normal and the debugging mode. Pushing <code>F8</code> gives you
another menu where you can select more booting options - like a command
prompt-only version or the infamous <code>last good</code> option. 
For the moment I simply waited eight seconds until the normal boot process started. 

The developers have changed the bootup screen a bit by adapting the XP look and feel. 
Generally said the bootup process is very
streamlined and offers a whole variety of options for the advanced user.
But even the normal [PEBCAC ][6] can easily reach the desktop interface.
Presently the ReactOS kernel (which aims to be compatible with WinNT
5.2) offers about 25 to 30 percent of the [functionality it will finally
have in 1.0][8]. As a result of the broad kernel redesign in 0.2 to 0.3 the
current release faces a lot of regressions in some applications that were
already useable in 0.2.

### Software

ReactOS actually comes with a small amount of pre-installed software packages. 
Taking a closer look the team is working hard to
offer a free replacement of commonly used Win Software. Naturally it has the
[Command Prompt][9] as well as Regedit, Notepad and WordPad. It also features
a scientific Calculator as well as the not-so-well-known Windows commandline classics like
<code>shutdown.exe</code>, <code>regsvr32.exe</code> or <code>telnet</code>. 
Most of these basic programs were borrowed from the wine project. 
Together with the relatively stable kernel
ReactOS already has a solid basis for further software development. Such
Bluescreens are (really!) an exception: If you need a package that
is not installed by default you can upgrade your system by installing software
just as you would on Windows. There are many packages that run out of the box
without further tweaking. Just look at the [list of supported software][10] on
the interwebs! The newly integrated Downloading-Tool - simply called
__Download!__ - can help you to install compatible software with just one
click. Because it's work in progress there are not so many programs available.
You can select between the categories __Internet &amp; Network__, __Development__,
__Games &amp; Fun__ and __Tools__. Some cool open source apps like Firefox,
Thunderbird, [Samba][11], OpenTTD, 7zip and &mu;Torrent are already ready to
use. In later versions it will be possible to update the list of preconfigured
packages. That's why I see the __Download!__ feature as a promising invention.



### Hardware acceleration

Despite the fact that 0.3.3 has all the necessary drivers on board to run on
almost every machine without any need for configuration it may be quite
interesting to see ReactOS on full speed using original hardware drivers. In
my case I just needed to install the VMWare toolset that offers a major speed
burst when installed. I've added a CD-Rom Drive to my virtual machine and
clicked on __Virtual Machine__ > __Install VMWare Tools__ while ReactOS was
powered on. To my surprise almost everything worked like a charm and
I could install the VGA and the audio drivers to tune my system. After a
reboot - my system was messed up. The VGA resolution was down to 320-something
pixels which made using the OS an impossible task. I had no chance to adjust
the resolution with the common __Display Properties__ window nor did it work
to use Regedit and adjust the screen values manually. My second thought was
"No problem". In case of an emergency we have the Debug Mode on board.
Well, what can I say: It didn't work. It has the same screen resolution as the
normal mode. Maybe there is a [workaround to fix it][12] but I was too lazy to
figure it out and so I simply reset my virtual machine (There you have it,
bastard!). The free Windows clone would be quite a usable system for a normal
user if some of the configuration tools were already integrated. There is no
printing implementation and you can't presently use USB or firewire devices.
The latest release offers only rudimentary network support. That said the team
has worked hard to offer accessibility features as well as localization
adjustments. At the moment one can select between 90 (!) supported languages

### Stability

ReactOS still is (and will be for a long time)
an experimental System. It's normal for an unstable pre-release of an alpha
software to randomly freeze or hang or kill your machine or whatsoever. Don't
panic when you have to restart - it's (presently) normal. Don't expect ReactOS
to run all your .exe files it is a long and painful procedure to reach this
aim. That said ReactOS 0.3.3 is surprisingly stable compared to older
versions. Yes it occasionally hangs and it takes a nap from time to time when
all of your ram gets pwned. But don't be afraid: Just feel free to hang around
a bit dazzling with the software - actually having FUN using your computer. 0.3.3 is 
the first version that doesn't almost certainly crash after two
minutes of use or a wrong click in the system configuration menu (o_O).
ReactOS has grown up from a pure hacker playground to a mature, promising open
source alternative for proprietary M$ desktop products. Certainly you'll
find a bug and maybe want to help the developers. In this case just go to their site
and fill out a bug report and you can say to yourself that you've just
supported free software. The thing a good developer (and good engineer in
general) likes most is when somebody says __Thanks for all the great work!__
That's what I also like to say to the ROS team. Keep up the good work!
According to Wikipedia the next major release (i.e. 0.4) will offer basic USB
support and a complete SMB interface (making it fully compatible with the Windows
network subsystem). After that ReactOS will enter beta status and we will see
all the fancy __user-world__ stuff like NTFS support or DirectX 7-9 support. So
there is a long way to go and a lot to explore!

title: "Overkill: Java as a first programming language"
---

I recently talked to a student in my neighborhood about his first programming
experiences. They started learning *Java* at school and it soon turned out to be
horrible.

A lot of us learned coding in languages like *BASIC* or *Pascal*. There was no
object orientation, no sophisticated file I/O and almost no
modularization...and it was great. In *BASIC* you could just write

{% highlight python linenos=table %}

PRINT "HELLO WORLD"

{% endhighlight %}

and you were done. This was actually a running program solving a basic and
reoccurring problem: Output some text on a screen.

If you wanted to do the same thing in *Java* you simply write:

{% highlight java linenos=table %}

public class Main { 
  public static void main (String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, world!"); 
  }
}

{% endhighlight %}

Do you see how much knowledge about programming you must have to achieve the
easiest task one could think of? Describing the program to a novice programmer
may sound like this:

> Create a Main class containing a main-method returning void expecting a
> string array as single argument using the `println` method of the `out` object of
> class `PrintStream` passing your text as single argument.

&mdash; please just don't forget your brackets. This way your first programming hours are guaranteed to
be great fun.

OK. So what are the alternatives? I admit that nobody wants to write *BASIC*
anymore because of its lack of a sophisticated standard library for graphics
(*Java* doesn't have one either) and its weak scalability. The language has to
be simple and clean. It should be fast enough for numerical tasks but not as
wordy as the rigid C-type bracket languages (sorry C++ guys). It should have a
smooth learning-curve and provide direct feedback (compiled languages often
suck at that point). It should encourage clean code and reward best practices.
One language that provides all that is _*Python*_.

And *Python* has even more: hundreds of libraries that help you with almost
everything, good integration into common IDEs (PyDev in Eclipse, IDLE...), a
precise and elegant syntax.

Here is our program from above written in *Python*:

{% highlight python linenos=table %}

print("Hello World")

{% endhighlight %}

There's no need to know about object orientation, scopes and function
arguments at this point. No house-holding or book-keeping. Yes, it's an
interpreted language but that's not a deal breaker for beginners.

If you aren't convinced yet, printing and formatting text output in *Java* is
relatively easy for an advanced programmer but the really ugly stuff begins
with file input:

{% highlight java linenos=table %}

import java.io.BufferedReader; 
import java.io.FileNotFoundException; 
import java.io.FileReader; 
import java.io.IOException; 
 
public class fileIO { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        String filename = "test.txt", line; 
        try { 
            BufferedReader myFile = 
                new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filename)); 
            
            while ( ( line = myFile.readLine()) != null) { 
                System.out.println(line);
            } 
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { 
            e.printStackTrace(); 
        } catch (IOException e) { 
            e.printStackTrace(); 
        } 
    } 
} 

{% endhighlight %}

I hear you say: "Dude, file I/O is pretty complex. It's just the way it is".
That's true... _internally_ . But the user should get an easy interface. *Python*
shows how it's done:

{% highlight python linenos=table %}

file = open("test.txt")
text = file.read()
print(text);

{% endhighlight %}

The code goes hand in hand with the natural understanding of how the process
works: "The computer opens a file, reads it and prints it". Even a five year
old kid can understand that. Nobody would start to explain: "Before you can
read a file you need a BufferedReader that works on a FileReader..." even if
this is exactly how it works _internally_. You want to explain the big picture
at first. The elementary principles of teaching a computer how to do useful
stuff. Otherwise you will start frustrating beginners and fool them into
thinking that they are not bright enough for programming. Programming is fun
and starting with it is the most important step. So don't spoil that
experience with layers of unneeded abstraction.

<p class="intro">I maintain a list of movies with little twists in it. Some call them mindfuck movies others use the term film noir. A lot of my favorite movies fall into that genre which explains my high ratings (I haven't seen the movies without a rating yet). If you know a movie that fits into the list <a href="/about">I would be glad to hear from you.</a></p>
